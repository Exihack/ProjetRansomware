## Key points :

1. Propagation : Mail, macros, rubber ducky

2. Ransomware : code in python, remove from memory, remove the file from HDD, evade anti-virus solutions

3. Server : stock the ransomware and key, generate an unique ID for the victim machine

4. Check the conference about it (between 7:30 et 35:30, in French)
